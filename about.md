Hello!! I recently graduated from Northwestern University, where I studied Computational & Systems Biology, Data Science, Linguistics; I also am part of the Honors Program in Medical Education (HPME) cohort, the BS/MD program with the Feinberg School of Medicine. Before medical school, I am pursuing a MS in Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School. Currently in my gap years before my medical school matriculation, I'm applying my experience in the medical, research, data analytical fields to facilitate and develop creative approaches to the complexities surrounding healthcare.

My experience ranges from working with murine models to laying in bed coding. I first got involved in research my freshman year of high school. Since then, I have been in the laboratory identifying fault lines in pre-existing treatment paradigms, recognizing the potential in overlooked areas to tangibly improve care. My work has been nationally recognized by Regeneron's Science Talent Search and has been funded by several grants.

However, my time in college has allowed me to extend from <em>in vitro</em> and <em>in vivo</em> techniques into more <em>in silico</em> and dry lab techniques. By leveraging these tools, I have been able to expand my research from the lab bench to the clinical level. With my technical skills and background in medical research, I have been able to advise and overlook the development of other companies' projects utilizing AI to restructure the current state of healthcare; my roles in business management achieving venture capital funding for biotech startups has given me the knowledge of what these technologies need from start-to-finish. I hope to transition into a physician-scientist capable of identifying, leading, developing, and deploying technologies to provide high-impact etiologies and treatments.

In my free time, I like to bike around the lake, photograph the weird things around me, boulder while listening to R&B music, and grow herbs in Chobani yogurt containers. Also, feel free to email me any good overnight oats recipes you know of.
