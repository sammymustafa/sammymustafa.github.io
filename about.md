Hello!! I am currently a senior at Northwestern University majoring in Computational & Systems Biology and minoring in Data Science and Linguistics. I am also part of the Honors Program in Medical Education (HPME), the BS/MD program with the Feinberg School of Medicine. For my gap years before my matriculation to medical school, I hope to utilize my experience in the medical, research, and data analytical fields to facilitate and develop creative approaches to the complexities surrounding healthcare.

My experience expands both in the lab and my little screen. Beginning by conducting in vitro

You can find me biking around, listening to R&B music on walks, thrifting, crocheting, or making overnight oats.
