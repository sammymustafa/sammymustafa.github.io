Hello!! I am currently a senior at Northwestern University majoring in Computational & Systems Biology and minoring in Data Science and Linguistics. I am also part of the Honors Program in Medical Education (HPME), the BS/MD program with the Feinberg School of Medicine. For my gap years before my matriculation to medical school, I hope to utilize my experience in the medical, research, and data analytical fields to facilitate and develop creative approaches to the complexities surrounding healthcare.

My experience ranges from working with murine models to sitting in my bed coding. I first got involved in research my freshman year of high school. Since then, I have been in the laboratory identifying fault lines in pre-existing treatment paradigms, recognizing the potential in overlooked areas to tangibly improve care. My work has been nationally recognized by Regeneron's Science Talent Search and has been funded by several grants.

However, my time in college has allowed me to extend from <em>in vitro<em> and <em>in vivo<em> techniques into more <em>in silico<em> and dry lab techniques. By leveraging these tools, I have been able to expand my research from the lab bench to the clinical level. With my technical skills and background in medical research, I hope to transition into a physician-scientist capable of developing and deploying technologies to provide high-impact etiologies and treatments.

In my free time, I like to bike around the lake, photograph the little things that inspire me, listen to R&B music while crocheting, and munch on olives while watching the Price is Right. Also, feel free to email me any good overnight oats recipes you know of.
