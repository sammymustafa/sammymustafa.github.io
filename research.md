 I specifically hope to employ the panomics, environmental, and lifestyle data of patients’ first-degree relatives to develop evidence-based diagnoses and treatment options—a burgeoning but underexplored area in precision psychiatry. While family members may not be experiencing identical conditions, data similarities across kin may buttress a bottom-up approach (Bylstra et al., 2021). Utilizing AI technologies for a potential dissertation, I hope to shed light on how specific genomic and external differences can aid in suggesting personalized treatments schemes in depression.
