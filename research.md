Delays in remission are the norm in mental health treatment, where trial-and-error occupies the modus operandi for antidepressant prescription. This is despite an error rate up to 60%. Preliminary psychiatric studies harnessing data to deliver personalized mental healthcare has the potential to revolutionize the efficacy of treatment for struggling patients. I am working towards developing precision technologies aimed at individualizing mental disorder treatment and improving clinical outcomes.

I specifically hope to employ the panomics, environmental, and lifestyle data of patients’ first-degree relatives to develop evidence-based diagnoses and treatment options—a burgeoning but underexplored area in precision psychiatry. While family members may not be experiencing identical conditions, data similarities across kin may buttress a bottom-up approach. Utilizing machine learning and AI technologies, I hope to shed light on how specific genomic and external differences can aid in suggesting personalized treatments schemes in depression.

I am beginning to do this by studying the comorbidity of mental health disorders with cardiovascular diseases under Dr. Faraz Ahmad in the Health & Biomedical Informatics division of the Department of Preventive Medicine at the Feinberg School of Medicine. Through large-scale data-sets, I hope to use this data to refine the process of healthcare to include patient's mental health status.
