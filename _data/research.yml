desc1: 'Pseudogenes, genes that lack the ability to produce functional proteins despite high resemblance to a parent gene, were previously viewed as nonfunctional “junk” cluttering the human genome. However, they have been recently recognized for their roles in gene regulation.',
desc2: 'Glioblastomas are malignant brain tumors that can be characterized by the over expression of microRNA-26a targeting the PTEN tumor-suppressor protein. The microRNA binds to a site of the protein to silence its effects.',
desc3: 'For my research, I overexpressed the PTENP1 pseudogene <em>in vitro<em> and found it had several therapeutic effects in glioblastoma cells. Due to the similarity of their binding sites, the treatment tricked the microRNA to bind to the fake gene rather than the real one, allowing the tumor suppressor to mitigate the malignancy of the brain tumor.'

- {name: 'SERBP1: Exploiting RNA-Binding Protein-Mediated PAI-1 Inhibition', url: '/research/serbp1.pdf',
desc1: 'Elevated levels of the PAI-1 protein serves as an indicator of conditions associated with aging like obesity, insulin resistance, Alzheimer’s, and several fibroses. While not much is known about their interaction, SERBP1 is a mRNA binding protein that binds to and regulates the stability of the PAI-1 mRNA. SERBP1 has homology to intrinsically-disordered proteins that self-template in an infectious, prion-like manner to drive transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. 
',
desc2: 'Thus, my research focuses on probing and employing SERBP1 against PAI-1 in a model of cardiac fibrosis. The non-amyloid prion-like manner of SERBP1 has the potential of self-enhancing its efforts in lowering PAI-1 levels. Even more so, the intergenerational effectiveness of this solution is unwarranted.'
