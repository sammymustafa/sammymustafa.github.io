desc1: 'Pseudogenes, genes that lack the ability to produce functional proteins despite high resemblance to a parent gene, were previously viewed as nonfunctional “junk” cluttering the human genome. However, they have been recently recognized for their roles in gene regulation.',
desc2: 'Glioblastomas are malignant brain tumors that can be characterized by the over expression of miR-26a targeting the PTEN tumor-suppressor protein. The micro-RNA binds to a site of the protein to silence its effects.',
desc3: 'For my research, I overexpressed the PTENP1 pseudogene in vitro and found it had several therapeutic effects in glioblastoma cells. Due to the similarity of their binding sites, the treatment tricked the micro-RNA to bind to the fake gene rather than the real one, allowing the tumor suppressor to mitigate the malignancy of the brain tumor.'}
